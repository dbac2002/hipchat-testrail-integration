# hipchat-testrail-integration
web service to communicate between hipchat and testrail

more or less private repo. web service client using https://github.com/dbac2002/testrail-groovy-client to communicate between hipchat and testrail

So e.g. given an installed hipchat webhook, one could use the client to retrieve infos from testrail into hipchat

    /testrail get user(1) with 'name', 'id'
